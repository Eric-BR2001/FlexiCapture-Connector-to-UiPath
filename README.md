## About the ABBYY FlexiCapture Connector for UiPath
ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 enables users to perform high-quality full-text recognition, classify documents,
detect fields and capture their data, and convert files into various formats (e.g. searchable PDF).

ABBYY FlexiCapture Integration Solution for UiPath is intended for sending document files from UiPath
to ABBYY FlexiCapture and loading document files and captured data into the UiPath robotic process

ABBYY FlexiCapture Integration Solution for UiPath is provided as two separate solutions, a Multi-Task
Package and a Single-Task Package.

* The Multi-Task Package is intended for concurrent processing of multiple documents. Each activity in this solution is used for some type of interaction with ABBYY FlexiCapture.
